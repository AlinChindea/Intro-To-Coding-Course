# Soft Skills TA

## Whilst we are updating the Soft Skills Content this role isn't available

## Soft Skills Content

The main topics we wish to cover during these sessions are as follows: 

* Teamwork: Learning to work individually and in small teams using digital tools
* Communication: Learning how to interact and collaborate efficiently with other students or mentors to complete each exercise
* Problem-solving and searching: Learning how to solve problems by slicing problems into smaller issues and searching online for solutions. 
* Confidence building: Bringing an awareness of the difficulties of technical and digital challenges and a self-belief of one’s capacity to achieve goals with effort and determination

### First Time Students

For new students we will run an introductory session, many students may be new to working collaboratively online and using digital tools. This session is an opportunity to introduce basic soft-skills principles and practice teamwork, communication, problem-solving and searching, and confidence building.

### Returning Students

Returning students will have covered the basic content at least once, if there is a group of returners this is an opportunity to break them out into a smaller group and continue work on those basic principles but add more in-depth content.   


## Soft Skills Session

The soft-skills content of the class comes in an one hour block. This session is designed to introduce students to fundamental soft-skills required to succeed in learning and employment. 

Following an introduction to the session by the lead instructor the class will split, with first time students remaining in the main room and returners going into break-out groups of 4-5 students with a TA per group. The main room will work on introductory topics whilst the returners will have the opportunity to expand into wider topics. During exercises TAs should encourage students to discuss the challenges they’ve come across, share solutions with each other and work together . The TA can offer guidance and advice when needed but should always try to encourage students to solve questions first. Group exercises are a powerful tool for introducing and practising soft skills, they also ensure that students are engaged and participate in the session which is essential for learning. 

N.B. Please look over the exercises in the presentation below so that you can support a group in the break out rooms. We advise you have the presentation open during the session so you can follow along with the notes and support your group during exercises.
