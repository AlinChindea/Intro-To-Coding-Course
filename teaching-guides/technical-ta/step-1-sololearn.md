# Step 1 - Sololearn

Students in the Sololearn group should have ideally submitted at least one tutorial. 

The three Sololearn tutorials are:

* HTML Fundamental
* CSS Fundamentals
* Javascript Tutorial

This group should answer any questions students have come up with during the tutorials. Work through the three topics on Sololearn and ask questions to prompt discussion and boost understanding. Screensharing on sololearn.com \(you will need to register an account\) or live coding are valuable way to explain concepts in an engaging and interactive way. 

Once the workshop ends, remind student's that they can get further help with the Sololearn material on the Applicant's Slack channel. On the channel there will be volunteers who can answer their questions and help them with the coursework.
