# Step 1 - Sololearn

Students in the Sololearn group should have ideally submitted at least one tutorial. 

* This group should answer any questions students have come up with during the tutorials
* Work through the three topics on Sololearn and ask questions to prompt discussion and boost understanding
* Screensharing Sololearn or livecoding are valuable way to explain concepts in an engaging and interactive way.
