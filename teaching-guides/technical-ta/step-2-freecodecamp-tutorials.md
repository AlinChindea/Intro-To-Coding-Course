# Step 2 - FreeCodeCamp Tutorials

The FreeCodeCamp tutorials cover the following topics found at [https://www.freecodecamp.org/learn](https://www.freecodecamp.org/learn) under the responsive web design certification

This group should answer any questions students have come up with during the tutorials. Work through the three topics on Sololearn and ask questions to prompt discussion and boost understanding. Screensharing on sololearn.com \(you will need to register an account\) or live coding are valuable way to explain concepts in an engaging and interactive way.
