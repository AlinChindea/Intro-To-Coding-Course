# Step 3 & 4 - Tribute and Landing pages

These students have completed all of the tutorials up until this point and have started working with more freedom and range. This is a great opportunity to encourage students to be curious and challenge themselves. 

* Students should be in a position to work out the solutions to their challenges with a small amount of encouragement/guidance. Work with the group to collectively answer questions etc. 
* We value improvements. When students have 'completed' their pages ask how they could improve them and work with them to achieve this
